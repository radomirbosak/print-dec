print-dec
=========

Prints a decimal representation of a number stored in `rax` register. 

This project is a test of basic arithmetic operations (mainly integer division) in assembler on 64-bit machines.
The number to be displayed is hard-coded in the source file. Note that this program doesn't use any `C` functions - that would be too easy
